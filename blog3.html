    In the words of a stripper, Guys live in desperation and die in despair.<br><br>

I think there are 2 type of guys. <br>The optimist and the realist.<p> The optimist always sees the opportunity with a woman and always makes a move no matter how obvious it is it is a setup like you said.
  <p>The realist is like a toddler who touches a hot stove. After making moves and getting burned repeatedly he learns where his wheelhouse is and knows better than to deviate from it. <br>Regardless of how enticing it is.
I am the latter and whenever an attractive woman so much as talks to me I'm always suspicious. <br>That doesn't mean i can't be temporarily misled. <p>I was talking to an Asian lady the other day. She played the role beautiful woman but she lamented about how fat and ugly she was.<br>Of course she responses from 50 guys telling her how attractive she was. Then the next day she posted a pic of her wearing some sexy lingerie. That should have tipped me off right there. But by the 3rd day it'd hit me it didn't add up. So i stopped responding altogether. Obviously it was someone faking. Who knows if it was even a woman.
