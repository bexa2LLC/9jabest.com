    A family of eight travelling home for the New Year celebration has died in an auto crash at the Amanwozuzu junction in the Ikeduru Local Government Area of Imo State.<br><br>

City Round gathered that the incident happened about 3 pm on Friday when the father of the family who conveyed his wife and children in a Sienna vehicle ran into a stationary truck carrying an iron rod.<br><br>

Our correspondent learned that some residents and policemen broke the vehicle to recover the bodies of the family members and deposited their corpses at a morgue.
    Confirming the incident, the Divisional Police Officer in charge of the Ikeduru LGA, Lucky Ahiole, a Chief Superintendent of Police, noted that the stationary truck was parked at the roadside when the driver of the Sienna vehicle ran into it.

The DPO said, “Eight died and we have taken them to a morgue. We had to break the Sienna vehicle to bring out the dead bodies. The rod pierced their eyes and bodies and even the children died.”<br><br><br>
